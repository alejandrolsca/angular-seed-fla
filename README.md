Angular Seed For Large Applications


This seed uses Watchify to generate a final bundle.js,
is intendeed for modular applications, 
each module has its own folder for services, directives, controllers, etc... and each module is in a separate folder.

Also you can have nested modules if you want a better control of which modules are part of others,
All the modules could have their own .config phase, you dont need to configure all the routes in one file.
this way you can have an unlimited module application and in a better organized way.


Hope this helps anyone :)

Please feel free to improve this seed!
